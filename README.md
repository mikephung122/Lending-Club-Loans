# Lending-Club-Loans
Exploratory data analysis of Lending Club loan data.

## Overview
Lending Club is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to offer loan trading on a secondary market.  In exchange for competitive returns, investors purchase Notes, which correspond to fractions of loans.  LendingClub screens borrowers, facilitates the transaction, and services the loans.  Borrowers use loans to consolidate debt, improve their homes, finance major purchases, and more.  Lending Club provides statistics and visualizations for Platform Highlights, Investor Performance and Loans while also providing access to the data used to create them.  The purpose of this project is to explore, analyze and summarize the lending club data to better understand Lending Club loans and suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena that could be used to improve them.
